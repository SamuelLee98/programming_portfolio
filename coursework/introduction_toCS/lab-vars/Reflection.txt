I would make the while loop repeat until the loop has created the same number of digits provided by the input. I am not sure exactly how I would do this because I am not familiar with loops yet. In each iteration, the while loop would find the modulus of the input and 10 ^ n, where n= one place higher than the desired digit. Subsequently, with the exception of the one\'92s place, all the previous digits found would be subtracted from the modulus. (i.e if you want to find the 100\'92s, subtract the tens and the one\'92s from the modulus). }
